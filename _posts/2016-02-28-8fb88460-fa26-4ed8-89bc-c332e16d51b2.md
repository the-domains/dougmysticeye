This site is dedicated to my hobby in Games. With over 500 videos on various boardgames and video games to my credit plus my efforts in game design and published games as well as fiction this site will bring all that together.

My main objective is to help you in seeing how to play new board games, to see if they are for you, and to demonstrate the game play. This way you will know if they are right for your collection.
